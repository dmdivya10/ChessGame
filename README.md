# ChessGame

Implemented Chess Game using OOP principles and basic game logic.

The major classes are as :

Spot: A spot represents one block of the 8×8 grid and an optional piece.
Piece: The basic building block of the system, every piece will be placed on a spot. Piece class is an abstract class. The extended classes (Pawn, King, Queen, Rook, Knight, Bishop) implements the abstracted operations.
Board: Board is an 8×8 set of boxes containing all active chess pieces.
Player: Player class represents one of the participants playing the game.
Move: Represents a game move, containing the starting and ending spot. The Move class will also keep track of the player who made the move.
Game: This class controls the flow of a game. It keeps track of all the game moves, which player has the current turn, and the final result of the game.
